# Random Color Generator React App

This project uses React to render a website that contains a button that displays random colors, or user-defined colors if the user enters data in the predefined fields.

## Usage

Simply click the button to make the color change. Enter _hue_ and _luminosity_ for an approximate fit color. Enter _height_ and _width_ to adjust the button size.
Press the button that appears below to revert to default.

**Have fun!**
